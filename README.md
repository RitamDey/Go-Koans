# Go Koans

Solution to the Go Koans that I found. This the original repo [cdarwin/go-kaons](https://github.com/cdarwin/go-koans)


## Running the Koans

1. Run `go test`.
1. Make the failing tests pass, by replacing these types of `__variables__` with real values.


## Helpful References

Bookmark the [spec](http://golang.org/ref/spec) and the [packages listing](http://golang.org/pkg/).
You can also run the Go website locally with `godoc -http=:8080`.

## Go support in Vim

If you have an interest in a more fancy vim setup, I urge you to consider
the post on the [Go Development Environment for Vim](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/vimgo-development-environment/)
on the Gopher Academy Blog.

## Go-Koans support in Emacs

[Jacek Wysocki](https://github.com/exu) has provided some nice Go Koans helper
scripts for Emacs users at [exu/go-koans.el](https://github.com/exu/go-koans.el)
